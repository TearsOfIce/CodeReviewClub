# CodeReviewClub
A social club for coders where each member writes step-by-step the same toy app than the others and where we code review each step within small groups of members: that's for the sake of self-improvement and clean-code, not in order to write a toy app.

We will write a Java-based webapp, where we fancy writing by ourselves as much code as we can: we're not supposed to use a lib for everything and not to use bloated code generators like JHipster (which I love if you ask, but this is not relevant here).

For the features to implement, see the project wiki. But remember: this is meant to be a club, you're not supposed to do this on your own. You can tell about the club to anybody you wish and you can fork entirely new clubs.

By the way: the app to write is a totally, utterly original TO-DO list webapp. Yes, one more. :-)

Each club member will fork this repo and work on his own copy. This repo is not meant to contain actual code, just to contain the specifications of the app to write.

One more thing: TDD & automated tests as much as possible, please (or as few as possible, if you don't feel comfortable with these subjects, but it's a great opportunity to learn these too).
